Summary on the history and evolution of the free monad


This repository contains the LaTeX sources for my **Hauptseminar** in
the **Technische Universit√§t Dresden**.

The paper is an overview of the evolution if the *Monad* abstraction
for effect handling as used in the Haskell language ecosystem with
particular focus on recent developments of free and freer monads which
are used in scrap-your-boilerplate monad implementations as well as,
even more prominently, in an extensible, composable effect system
implementation, the `Eff` monad.
