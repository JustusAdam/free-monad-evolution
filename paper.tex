\begin{abstract}
Side effects are the sore spot for pure languages. The mathematical
beauty of referential transparency has to be broken to allow crude and
unpredictable outside interactions, such as network and filesystem
accesses, that are necessary to write useful programs.

Fortunately with the Monad an abstraction was discovered that allowed
safe and transparent, sequential interaction with an arbitrary ambient
environment.

Yet it too is flawed. Versatile though the Monad is, composing
effects in a reusable fashion proved difficult and has performance
implications which increase in severity as the granularity gets finer.

With the free monad we now finally not only obtain a way to compose
arbitrary effects together in an efficient way but can also easily
implement effects via transformation into other effects and even
implement the same effect in different ways depending on needs and
constraints of its application.

This paper provides an overview of the origins of the Monad, how its
shortcomings lead to the invention of transformers, then the free
monad, and eventually the freer monad, how free and freer monads work
and how they can be used to realise our collective dream of pure,
efficient, composable and versatile ambient interactions.
